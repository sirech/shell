## Dot files

These are configuration files for some common programs. To use them,
link them by calling the `install.sh` script.

### TMUX

The _tmux_ configuration relies on
[TPM](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm), which can be installed by running:

    git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
    
Once installed the plugins can be added with CTRL+X I (while on a tmux session)
